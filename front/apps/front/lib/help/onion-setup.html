    <h1>Network Setup</h1>
    <p>For your represetnative to be reachable on a mobile phone (or
    any other device not directly connected to the internet) some kind
    of tunnel service is required.</p>
    <p>In principle this could be achieved among other options by a
    reflector service, virtual private network, I2P or an onion
    router.  Future versions will probably support more of these
    options.  Currently only onion routing is supported.</p>
    <h2>Setting Up Onion Routing</h2>
    <h3>On Android: Orbot Setup</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Install <code>Orbot</code> from play store, f-droid or elsewhere.</li>
      <li>Using the upper right menu configure a onion service
      (a.k.a. "hidden service") to listen on tor port <code>443</code>
      and forward to port <code>7443</code>.  Give it any name you like.</li>
      <li>Stop and restart Orbot.</li>
      <li>Visit the onion service menu again.  This time the service
      should be listet.  Long-tap the entry and select <em>copy to
      clipboard</em>.</li>
      <li>Go back and paste the entry into the <code>CN</code>
      field. The <code>CN</code> field should not contain the service
      address (ending in <code>.onion</code>).</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>On Linux: Tor</h3>
    <p>For the setup of an onion service on Linux install
    <code>tor</code> and configure a onion service in
    <code>torrc</code> to listen on port <em>443</em> and forward to
    <code>127.0.0.1:7443</code>.</p>
