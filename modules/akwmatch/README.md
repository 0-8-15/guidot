# Pattern Matching Syntactic Extensions for Scheme

Author: Andrew K. Wright, 1993

## Changes

- split into syntax and sprocedures
- add(ing) build process(es) for various implementations

## Mission

- Keep the original source around.  The original distribution is at
  this time no longer available.
- Support simple Scheme implementations, which do not have syntax-rules

## Issues

- (unconfirmed): Seems either quasi-pattern do not work for gambit
  here. (Or my tests where wrong).
